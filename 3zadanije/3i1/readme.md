## What it does
Operators: `+  -  *`  
`/` is not implemented here (will print “Unknown operator”).

---

## Build

```bash
gcc 3i1.c -o 3i1



## How it works

	checks there are exactly 3 args (plus program name)
	converts argv[1] and argv[3] to int with atoi
	takes argv[2][0] as operator
	switch does +, -, *
	prints Result: <number>

## Examples
    ./3i1 10 + 5
    Output: Result: 15
